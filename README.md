As practice, I decided to code up a solution to this prompt:

‚ÄúDesign a restaurant reservation platform (like OpenTable or Resy) that allows users to search for restaurants and make real-time reservations. You should support high-end restaurants with limited seating, multiple turn times, and complex rules like table joins, holds, and cancellation policies.‚Äù

‚∏ª

üß© Requirements

Functional:
	‚Ä¢	Search for restaurants by location, cuisine, and availability.
	‚Ä¢	View restaurant availability in real-time.
	‚Ä¢	Make, modify, and cancel reservations.
	‚Ä¢	Restaurants can configure:
	‚Ä¢	Table layouts (e.g. table joins for large parties)
	‚Ä¢	Turn times (e.g. 90 minutes per seating)
	‚Ä¢	Blackout periods (e.g. private events)
	‚Ä¢	No-show and cancellation policies.

Non-Functional:
	‚Ä¢	High availability and low-latency (esp. for booking flow).
	‚Ä¢	Handle traffic spikes (e.g., 7 PM slots at popular restaurants).
	‚Ä¢	Strong consistency for reservation confirmation.
	‚Ä¢	Multi-tenant (many restaurants, each with custom configs).
	‚Ä¢	Mobile and web clients (assume API backend).


## Getting Started

With docker compose, run the command

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

That will start the postgres database and seed it with some reservations


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
