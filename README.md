As practice, I decided to code up a solution to this prompt:

‚ÄúDesign a restaurant reservation platform (like OpenTable or Resy) that allows users to search for restaurants and make real-time reservations. You should support high-end restaurants with limited seating, multiple turn times, and complex rules like table joins, holds, and cancellation policies.‚Äù

‚∏ª

üß© Goals / Requirements

Functional:
- Search for restaurants by location, cuisine, and availability. ‚úÖ
- View restaurant availability in real-time. ‚úÖ (can view availability but no real-time websocket updates)
- Make, modify, and cancel reservations. ‚úÖ
- Restaurants can configure: 
- Table layouts (e.g. table joins for large parties) - ‚úÖ via Table model with isJoinable for table joins, no config UI
- Turn times (e.g. 90 minutes per seating) - ‚úÖ via TurnTimeRule model (different turn times by party size), no config UI
- Blackout periods (e.g. private events) - ‚úÖ via SpecialPeriod model with isBlackout flag, no config UI
- No-show and cancellation policies. - ‚úÖ via CancellationPolicy model, no config UI

Non-Functional:
- High availability and low-latency (esp. for booking flow). ‚ùå
- Handle traffic spikes (e.g., 7 PM slots at popular restaurants) ‚ùå
- Strong consistency for reservation confirmation. ‚ùå
- Multi-tenant (many restaurants, each with custom configs). ‚ùå
- Mobile and web clients (assume API backend) - web client only

Here's what the application looks like:

## Getting Started

With docker compose, run the command

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

That will start the postgres database and seed it with some reservations


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
